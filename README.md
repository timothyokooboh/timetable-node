# timetable-node
An API for generating timetables and authenticating users

# How to get started

1. Clone the repo

2. Install the dependencies
<kbd> npm install </kbd>

3. Start the node server

<kbd> npm start </kbd>

If successful, on the terminal you should see 
<i> "application running on port 8080. <br> Connected to db" </i>

# Note

To consume the API on the Vue front end, you need to keep this application running. That is, the node server must keep on running.
